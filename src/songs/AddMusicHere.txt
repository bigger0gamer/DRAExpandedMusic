Add your custom music here! Anything ffmpeg accepts should work, such as
.mp3
.wav
.flac
.opus

You can even add .xa, but keep a backup, since the packxap.sh script will move and delete it.

Once you have added your music, you can build by:

cd into build env:

sh extract.sh

then cd into src

sh packxap.sh
sh build.sh
